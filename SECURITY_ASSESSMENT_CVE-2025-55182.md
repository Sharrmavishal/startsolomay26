# Security Assessment: CVE-2025-55182 (React Server Components RCE)

**Date:** December 7, 2025  
**CVE:** CVE-2025-55182  
**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 10.0)  
**Status:** ✅ **NOT AFFECTED**

## Vulnerability Summary

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) in React 19.x and Next.js applications.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- React 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0
- Next.js 15.x, Next.js 16.x, Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases

**Patched Versions:**
- React 19.2.1+
- Next.js (see [official announcement](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478))

## Project Assessment

### Current Stack
- **React Version:** 18.2.0 (package.json) / 18.3.1 (installed)
- **Framework:** Vite (not Next.js)
- **Architecture:** Client-side React application
- **React Server Components:** ❌ Not used

### Analysis Result

✅ **This project is NOT affected by CVE-2025-55182** because:

1. **React Version:** Uses React 18.x, not React 19.x (vulnerable versions)
2. **No React Server Components:** This is a client-side React application using Vite
3. **No Next.js:** The vulnerability primarily affects Next.js applications using RSC
4. **Architecture:** Traditional client-side React app, not server-side rendering with RSC

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check React version
npm list react react-dom

# Verify no React 19 dependencies
npm list | grep react | grep -E "19\."

# Check for Next.js
npm list next
```

## Future Security Considerations

### When Upgrading to React 19

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** If upgrading to React 19 in the future:

1. **Always use React 19.2.1 or later** (patched version)
2. **If using React Server Components:**
   - Ensure you're using the latest patched version
   - Review RSC security best practices
   - Consider implementing Cloud Armor WAF rules if deploying on Google Cloud
3. **Monitor React security advisories:**
